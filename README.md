# README Generator

## Description

This project was developed for Homework 7 of the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp program. The goal is to build an application that will allow users to develop a high-quality README file. Using this code and Node.js, the user will be asked a series of questions that they will answer in the command line. A README-new.md file will be created with the user's input in a preset template. This saves the user time and allows them to dedicate more time to the rest of their project. I mainly used JavaScript, Node.js, and Markdown to create this project. This project has not only broadened my knowledge of command line applicability, but it has also taught me how to troubleshoot outside of a browser environment without the help of Chrome DevTools.

## Installation

1. First, navigate to the directory on your local device where you would like the files to be stored.

2. Clone the repo to your local device. This can be done by following the link to the GitHub Repo, clicking the green "Code" button, copying either the HTTPS or SSH filepath, and then running the following code:

    ```sh
    git clone <filepath>
    ```

3. In the command line, install dependencies using the following:

    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

4. Now, run Node.js on the index.js file:

    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```

5. You should then be prompted to answer a series of questions. After answering all of these questions, a README-new.md file should be created in your directory with the information you've entered.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
